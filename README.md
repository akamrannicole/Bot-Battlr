## Bot Battlr

Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you
can custom build your own Bot Army! This is our app:

## Description

This is my phase 2 Week 2 code challenge at Moringa School.

This is where I will build out a React application that displays that displays a list of available bots, among other features

## Demo

Use this gif as an example of how the app should work.

## Tools used

- vs code

- json server

- GitHub

- Google Chrome.

- Git

## Setup/Installation requirements

**To use this repo on your machine follow the steps below**

- Open a terminal/command line interface on your computer

- Clone the repo by using the following:

    git clone:https://github.com/Sharonobinda/Bot-Battlr.git

- Change directory to the repo folder;

  cd Bot-Battlr

To Open the repo in Visual Studio Code: code .

**Use the following steps to run the application;**

- First, make sure that you have 'json-server' installed globally or locally in your project.

- In this project, you will install it locally by navigating to your project directory and run the following command on your vs code terminal;

npm install json-server

- Also, ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed and that they are up to date

**Then follow the instructions below for live server to work well with json-server​****

- Run the following command to get server started:​npx json-server --watch db.json
- Test your server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:3000/bots/
- In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app on port 8000.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
